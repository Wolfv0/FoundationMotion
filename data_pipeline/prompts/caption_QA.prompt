# Background and task
You are provided with a video and a detailed video caption that describes object motions and spatial relationships. 
Your task is to generate a list of concise questions and corresponding answers that evaluate a viewer's understanding of object motion analysis and spatial relationships.


# Requirements
Question coverage should focus on five main categories:

**1. Motion Recognition Questions:**
- **Action description**: What action is [object/person] performing? (e.g., raising hand, skiing, cooking, walking, etc.)
- **Activity identification**: Describe the specific motion or gesture being performed
- **Behavior characterization**: What type of movement pattern is observed?

**2. Action Order Questions:**
- **Temporal sequence**: Which action happens first/second/last?
- **Action timing**: What action occurs before/after [specific action]?
- **Sequential events**: In what order do the actions unfold?

**3. Motion-related Object Questions:**
- **Actor identification**: Which object/person performs [specific action]?
- **Object-action association**: What does [object] do in the video?
- **Agent-activity linking**: Who or what is responsible for [specific motion]?

**4. Location-related Motion Questions:**
- **Spatial motion context**: Where does [action] take place in the scene?
- **Position-based activity**: What motion happens in the [left/right/center/upper/lower] part of the scene?
- **Spatial properties**: How does the location affect or relate to the motion?

**5. Repetition Count Questions:**
- **Frequency counting**: How many times does [action] occur?
- **Repetitive patterns**: How often is [motion] repeated?
- **Cyclical behaviors**: What is the count of [repeated action]?

**6. Traditional Motion Analysis Questions:**
- **Direction**: Which direction does [object] move? (left, right, up, down, diagonal directions)
- **Distance**: How far does [object] move? (specific measurements, relative distances)
- **Velocity**: How fast does [object] move? (speed characteristics, acceleration patterns)
- **Trajectory**: What path does [object] follow? (straight, curved, circular, zigzag patterns)

**7. Spatial Relationship Questions:**
- **Relative positions**: Where is [object A] positioned relative to [object B]? (left/right/up/down/front/back)
- **Distance relationships**: How far apart are [object A] and [object B]?
- **Positional changes**: How does the spatial relationship between [object A] and [object B] change?

Answer requirements:
- Answers must be concise and directly address the question.
- Include specific directional terms, distance measurements, and spatial descriptors when available.
- Do not include extra explanations or thought processes in the answers.


# Task
First, generate a list of questions and answers as below, with an empty line between each question and answer pair. Do not include any other texts in the output.
Q1: ...
A1: ...

Q2: ...
A2: ...


Here are example questions and answers:
Q1: What action is the person performing with their right hand?
A1: The person is raising their right hand above their head.

Q2: Which action happens first in the video?
A2: The person picks up the cup before stirring.

Q3: What object performs the cutting motion?
A3: The knife performs the cutting motion on the vegetables.

Q4: Where in the scene does the stirring action take place?
A4: The stirring action takes place in the upper-left area of the kitchen counter.

Q5: How many times does the person wave their hand?
A5: The person waves their hand 3 times.

Q6: In which direction does the red ball move?
A6: The red ball moves diagonally from upper-left to lower-right.

Q7: How far does the cup travel during the video?
A7: The cup travels approximately 50cm across the table.

Q8: What type of trajectory does the spoon follow?
A8: The spoon follows a circular stirring motion.

Q9: Where is the bowl positioned relative to the cutting board initially?
A9: The bowl is positioned 20cm to the left of the cutting board.

Q10: How does the spatial relationship between the plate and the fork change?
A10: The fork moves from the right side to the left side of the plate.

Q11: At what speed does the person's hand move toward the object?
A11: The person's hand moves rapidly downward.

Q12: Which object is located on the upper-right side of the scene?
A12: The kitchen towel is located on the upper-right side.

Then, for each question and answer, turn the single answer into 4 multiple choices with reasonable choices generated from the caption but distinctive from the correct answer. 
Please make sure each choice in the four choices is distinctive and do not have ambiguity with any other choice.
Check the video content to make sure to never generate ambiguous multiple choices for the same question. 
Always put the correct answer at the first choice.


# Output format
The output format: output a list of strings and each string contains a question and its corresponding multiple choices as below.
The number of questions equal to the number of items in the list. 
Each question must have 4 choices listed, after A, B, C, D.
[
'Q1: ...
A: ...
B: ...
C: ...
D: ...', 

'Q2: ...
A: ...
B: ...
C: ...
D: ...',

...
]

The correct answer is always at A. Do not include any other texts in the output.
with an empty line between each question and answer pair. 

Focus on generating questions that test understanding of:
- Motion recognition and action identification (raising hand, cooking, walking, etc.)
- Action temporal sequences and ordering
- Object-action associations and actor identification
- Location-based motion analysis and spatial context
- Repetition counting and frequency analysis
- Object movement directions (left, right, up, down, diagonal)
- Movement distances and trajectories  
- Movement speeds and velocity patterns
- Spatial positioning (left/right/up/down relationships)
- Changes in spatial arrangements
- Object proximity and distance relationships
